# Mini_printf
remake of my ft_printf with just the basic (because it's faster when i put it in my program) 

It's a part of my libft. it's the file :
ft_printf.c
specifier.c
specifier2.c
specifier3.c
ft_transform_wchar.c

you can use only these specifier with it :
%s, %S, %p, %d, %c, %C, %b, %y, %w, %o, %u, %x, %X

(Makefile in libft)
